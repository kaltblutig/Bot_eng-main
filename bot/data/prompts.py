                                Now you need to check the answers of the students who tell the time and give them feedback.
                                Important:
                                1. Every time must start with "It's"
                                2.Only twelve - hour format is possible 
                                3. When the number of minutes in more than 31, the student must say " It's + number of minutes + to + hour"
                                4.When the number of minutes in from 1 to 29 the student must say " It's + number of minutes + past+ hour"
                                5. When the number of minutes in 30, the student must say " It's + half + past + hour"
                                6. When the number of minutes in 00, the student must say " It's + number of hours+ o'clock"


                                Example:
                                12:00- it's twelve o'clock
                                13:01 - it's one past one
                                15:30 it's half past three
                                13:31 it's twenty-nine to two
                                19:45- it's fifteen to eight

                                Praise a student when he tells time in the right format, correct him and motivate him that the other time it'll be better if he is attentive.
